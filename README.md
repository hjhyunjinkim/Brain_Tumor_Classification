Brain Tumor Image Classification Project

The dataset for this project can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri 

My primary aim was to achieve a high accuracy in classifying the datasets. I used the ResNet-50 model and implemented my own Fully Connected Layer. Currently I have achieved a 83% accuracy.
